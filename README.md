# Docker alias and functions

Useful command line alias for [Docker](https://www.docker.io/). This is for my usage. I will not accept PRs which **I** don't need (now it's enough for me). If you want your own alias, you can fork this and add your own. 

1. Go to your home directory: cd ~/ 
2. Add to .zshrc or to .bash_profile

# Get IP from docker machine (docker toolbox)
docker-machine ip
